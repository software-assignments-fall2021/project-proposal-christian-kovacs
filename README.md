## Motivation 
A study was conducted on Novak Djokovic's progress from being ranked 680 in 2004 to rank 3 in 2007 and to rank 1 in 2011. 
The way he was able to acheive that success was by winning more matches and he did that by winning more points.
Every point in tennis requires about 1-3 decisions. So, when he was ranked 680 he was winning 49% of his points. 
When he was ranked 3, he was winning 52% of his points and as number 1 he was winning 55% of his points. 
This goes to show that it only requires marginal improvements to make considerable progress towards your goal, any goal. 

Typically, self-improvement apps seem like a lot of commitment and they manage to scare off the users because improvement feels like a lot of work. 

## Customer Pain Point
And when people see a huge amount of work, they tend to shy away from it. 
This is preventing a lot of people from achieving their goals and their full potential.
For example - someone is trying to finish reading a book, but cannot find the motivation to do it. 
If you tell them that they have to read a "400 page book" or "an entire book," it tends to throw people off from finishing the book. 
But if you say something like "You jut need to read 10 pages today and you have time slot A and time slot B to do it," it seems more achievable. 

There are a lot of scheduling apps and motivation apps that are not being effective, as they are trying to be inspirational and not action oriented. 
The ones that can help out are paid counsellors that take time to understand what you're trying to achieve and what your life looks like. 
It is really hard to find an action-oriented app that is able to take into account a personal schedule and preferences to help achieve specific goals, also to help make goals. 

## Audience
This will be an application exclusively for students who are looking to achieve any goals (complete an assignment, read a book, finish knitting a scarf). 
These goals should be something that can be divided up into smaller tasks (which really covers most goals). 
This student should also use a calendar for organizing their time (or any other way the application can know when they are busy).
